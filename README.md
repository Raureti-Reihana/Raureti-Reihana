## ðŸ‘‹ Kia ora and welcome

I am a multi-skilled person with a diverse work background, currently transitioning into the tech industry. My experience spans physical labour, high-responsibility driving, caregiving, and cultural work, all of which have made me highly adaptable, resilient, and a clear communicator. My ability to work both independently and within a team has been shaped by these varied roles. Now, as I transition into tech, I bring these strengths to my passion for coding. This unique mix of practical and technical skills, along with my strong teamwork and communication abilities, makes me a well-rounded and versatile professional, ready to tackle any challenge in web development.

Below are some projects I have been part of:

Book Finder â€“ This project was completed on my own to test my full-stack skills. It was created to showcase the skills we learned during the course, which involved making a database using Knex and demonstrating the ability to send and receive requests from the database. While the app logic wasn't fully completed, it had all the functionality for POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests. This project also highlights our work with front-end routing, using components in React, and working with React hooks.

Stay Pawsitive â€“ This was one of my first group projects, and it was a lot of fun. The main objective was to consume APIs and make GET requests to display data. In this case, we successfully used a dog picture API.

Dreamfest â€“ Dreamfest was a project that had been partially completed, and we, the students, were tasked with finishing it. This project helped us learn how to make API requests that allowed us to create, edit, and delete events. I spent time understanding how to build functions that retrieved the necessary data without pulling in unnecessary information.

Rauretiâ€™s Blog â€“ This was one of the first pages we created to introduce ourselves, our learning plans, and other lessons we learned related to soft skills and efficient learning.
