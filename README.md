Ko Raureti Reihana Tōku ingoa

I am a multiskilled person who has a diverse work background and am transitioning into the tech industry.
I have a combination of physical labor, high-responsibility driving, caregiving, and cultural work which has made me highly adaptable, resilient, and a clear communicator. My ability to work both independently and within a team has been shaped by these diverse roles, and now, as I transition into the tech industry, I bring all these strengths to my passion for coding. This unique mix of practical and technical skills, coupled with my strong teamwork and communication abilities, makes me a well-rounded and versatile professional, ready to tackle any challenge in web development.
